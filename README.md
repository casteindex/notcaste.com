This is the repo for my personal website :)

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a custom theme. Feel free to take whatever inspiration you want from it, or clone it completely for that matter. Although I did write the HTML templates and CSS stylesheet, I completely stole the whole _look and feel_ of the site, so it can barely even be called my work.
