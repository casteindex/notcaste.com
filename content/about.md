This blog is my first dive into web development. Here, I'll share insights and experiences as I explore this new world, offering a mix of technical tutorials, personal anecdotes, film recommendations, and more.

### Colophon

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a custom theme. The source code for the entire website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/casteindex/notcaste.com). Feel free to take whatever inspiration you want from it, or clone it completely for that matter. Although I did write the HTML templates and CSS stylesheet, I completely stole the whole _look and feel_ of the site, so it can barely even be called my work.

### Contact
