Thanks for passing by.

This first post mainly serves to help me check if everything is working properly, but also as an introduction piece.

I am currently learning about web development and plan on this website to be a blend of a blog and a portfolio. I will probably use this platform to strengthen my knowledge through teaching, but I am also a mechanical engineer, so hopefully not all posts are going to be amateur ramblings. I hope that these two interests of mine bring out something innovative, that can inspire some idea to whoever is reading this.

Hope you enjoy :)
